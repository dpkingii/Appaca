# Appaca (ADC Bootcamp Hackathon)
<h1>What is Appaca?</h1>
Appaca is a full-stack application designed to streamline the process of matching mentors with students. Built with the goal of improving the ADC experience, the platform automates mentor group assignments and fosters meaningful engagement between participants. To encourage interaction, we incorporated a gamified points system centered around the activity “Two Truths, One Bug.”

<h1>What did we learn?</h1>
Throughout the development of Appaca, we gained valuable experience in full-stack application design and implementation. Many team members discovered just how much there is to learn when building a scalable app from scratch. One key challenge was setting up the backend infrastructure and deciding how to balance frontend and backend development. Ultimately, many of us worked on both in parallel, gaining practical skills in both areas.
