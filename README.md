# Appaca (ADC Bootcamp Hackathon)
<h1>What is Appaca?</h1>
Appaca is a full-stack app designed to facilitate matching mentors to students. We designed this from the perspective of making ADC easier to manage, automatically assigning mentors to groups and encouraging interaction between them. We designed a points feature to entice our mentors/students to play the game "Two Truths, One Bug" with one another.

<h1>What did we learn?</h1>
A lot of us learned that we have a lot to learn about developing apps, but this was a solid first step. The backend was pretty challenging to setup and we weren't sure which to develop first but a lot of us ended up working on both of the at the same time.
